  - 1st interview 1. Given an array full of integers from 0 to 4 in random order how will you sort this array. (I explained my approach he said it's good no need to code). 2. Given a singly linked list find if the list is a palindrome, you only have to head no length is given and you have to solve in one loop and one pass, O(n) (I explained my approach he said it's good no need to code). 3. Given a singly linked list and an integer n reverse the n size chunks and return the complete linked list. E.g. list 1->2->3->4->5->6 and n = 2 will return 2->1->4->3->6->5 I had to code the complete algo. 2nd Interview 4. He asked me to code the second question (palindrome). 5. He asked me to solve the two-sum problem in O(n) and a single loop. 6. He asked me to solve the balls in the bag problem analytical problem. 7. At last he gave me a simple database query that uses group by.
